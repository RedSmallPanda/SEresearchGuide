# Lessons of writing rebuttal for top conferences in Software Engineering

In software engineering domain, top conferences such as ICSE and FSE always require a rebuttal to given authors an opportunity to address reviewers’ concerns or misunderstandings. I have been writing rebuttals since 2015 with dozens of them submitted to FSE and ICSE. Although it did not change the results of my paper most times, rebuttal did work sometimes and even helped me win 2 ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Awards. Since new students in my group always wonder how to write rebuttals, I summarize several tips below:
- Adopt different strategies to write your rebuttal accordingly:
  - When getting all positive reviews, do not say too much, but clarify minor issues and acknowledge reviewers. (Less is more)
  - When getting all negative reviews, no need to write a rebuttal, since you cannot convince reviewers with 12-page double-column papers, let alone 500-750 words.
  - For borderline papers, identify the champion, and make sure to provide enough ammo for him to champion your work. If you still have space, try to convince reviewers with a weak reject, rather than that with strong reject.

- Identify and answer critical questions which may change reviewers’ mind. Try to merge common questions from reviewers and answer them by the reviewer order.
- At the beginning of each answer, please very briefly summerize reviewers’ questions as the title (e.g., “Model effectiveness(R1Q1, R2Q1)”) to help reviewers recall the **context**. Note that it should be compact as you only have very limited space!
- Try to be concise, while not repeating or copy-pasting sentences from the original manuscript. 
- When answering questions, please use some statistics/reference/experiment as the evidence to strongly support your argument, rather than just plain words.
- Formatting of your rebuttal may influence the readability. Different from the Easychair system, HotCRP supports latex writing, so you can add a list/table/figure within your text.
- If you succeeded previously in writing a rebuttal, please review it when writing a new rebuttal.

Good luck to your rebuttal!
